        It can be said of this poet that she was as important to Chicago as Chicago was to her. Born in Kansas, Brooks’s family moved to Chicago when she was rather young, thus giving her nearly an entire lifetime to let the influences of the city seep into her writing. After graduating from Wilson Junior College in 1936, Brooks submitted several poems to the Chicago Defender, which then published them, awarding the nascent poet limited, though helpful recognition. After years of work, she published her first collection of poems, A Street in Bronzeville (1945), in which she uplifted her ordinary neighbors and their struggles into extraordinary tales. With her next collection, Annie Allen (1949), Brooks was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, becoming the first African American to win the much-coveted literary prize. Throughout the rest of her life, she remained a citizen of Chicago and continued to author countless volumes of poetry as well as a children’s book and an autobiography. Her ability to bridge to gap between literary intellectuals and contentious black civil rights activists proved a major skill of hers and led to her becoming the Library of Congress consultant in poetry and the first poet laureate of Illinois. She continued to give back to the city that provided so much material for her by holding a position as an English professor at Chicago State University until her death.
