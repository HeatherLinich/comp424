        It can be said of this poet that she was as important to Chicago as Chicago was to her. Born in Kansas, Brooks’s family moved to Chicago when she was rather young,
        thus giving her nearly an entire lifetime to let the influences of the city seep into her writing. After graduating from Wilson Junior College in 1936, Brooks submitted
        several poems to the Chicago Defender, which then published them, awarding the nascent poet limited, though helpful recognition. After years of work, she published her
        first collection of poems, A Street in Bronzeville (1945), in which she uplifted her ordinary neighbors and their struggles into extraordinary tales. With her next collection,
        Annie Allen (1949), Brooks was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, becoming the first African American to win the much-coveted literary prize. Throughout the rest of her life,
        she remained a citizen of Chicago and continued to author countless volumes of poetry as well as a children’s book and an autobiography. Her ability to bridge to gap
        between literary intellectuals and contentious black civil rights activists proved a major skill of hers and led to her becoming the Library of Congress consultant in poetry
        and the first poet laureate of Illinois. She continued to give back to the city that provided so much material for her by holding a position as an English professor at Chicago
        State University until her death.

        Richard Nathaniel Wright was born on September 4, 1908, at Rucker's Plantation, between Roxie and the larger community of Natchez, Mississippi. His autobiography, Black Boy,
        covers the interval in his life from 1912 until May 1936. Richard's father left the family when the boy was six years old, and he did not see him for another 25 years.
        After his single parent mother became incapacitated with a stroke, he was separated from his younger brother and lived briefly with his uncle. At that time, 12 years of age,
        he had not yet had a single complete year of schooling. Soon Richard and his mother moved to the home of his maternal grandmother in Jackson, Mississippi, where he lived from
        early 1920 until late 1925. Finally he was able to attend school regularly, and after a year at the age of 13 entered the Jim Hill public school where he was shortly promoted
        to sixth grade, after only two weeks. Wright moved to Chicago in 1927. After securing employment as a postal clerk, he read other writers and studied their styles during his
        time off. In 1932, he began attending meetings of the John Reed Club. As the club was dominated by the Communist Party, Wright established a relationship with a number of party
        members. Especially interested in the literary contacts made at the meetings, Wright formally joined the Communist Party in late 1933 and as a revolutionary poet who wrote numerous
        proletarian poems "We of the Red Leaves of Red Books", for example), for The New Masses and other left-wing periodicals.  By 1935, Wright had completed his first novel, Cesspool,
        published as Lawd Today (1963), and in January 1936 his story "Big Boy Leaves Home" was accepted for publication in New Caravan. In February, he began working with the National
        Negro Congress, and in April he chaired the South Side Writers Group, whose membership included Arna Bontemps and Margaret Walker. Wright submitted some of his critical essays
        and poetry to the group for criticism and read aloud some of his short stories. Through the club, he edited Left Front, a magazine that the Communist Party
        shut down in 1937, despite Wright's repeated protests. Throughout this period, Wright also contributed to The New Masses magazine.

      <p class="authorBioText">
        Walker was born in Birmingham, Alabama, to Sigismund C. Walker, a Methodist minister, and Marion (née Dozier) Walker, who helped their daughter by teaching her philosophy and
        poetry as a child. Her family moved to New Orleans when Walker was a young girl. She attended school there, including several years of college, before she moved north to Chicago.
        In 1935, Walker received her Bachelor of Arts Degree from Northwestern University. In 1936 she began work with the Federal Writers' Project under the Works Progress Administration
        of the President Franklin D. Roosevelt administration during the Great Depression. She was a member of the South Side Writers Group, which included authors such as Richard Wright,
        Arna Bontemps, Fenton Johnson, Theodore Ward, and Frank Marshall Davis. In 1942, she received her master's degree in creative writing from the University of Iowa. In 1965, she returned
        to that school to earn her Ph.D.
